# Progress for Todo App Project

## What Works

- The Context7 MCP server has been successfully set up with a remote connection, accessible via `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`.
- The `resolve-library-id` tool was used to search for Next.js libraries, confirming the server's functionality with relevant results like `/vercel/next.js`.
- Markdown files in the memory bank have been updated to comply with linting rules MD022 and MD032, ensuring proper formatting.

## What's Left to Build

- Integration of Context7 MCP server tools into the development workflow for the Todo App, particularly for fetching documentation with `get-library-docs` when implementing new features or resolving issues.

## Current Status

- MCP server setup is complete and operational, ready to assist with up-to-date library documentation for ongoing and future development tasks.

## Known Issues

- Local installation of the Context7 MCP server on Windows encountered challenges, leading to the adoption of a remote server connection. No current issues with the remote setup.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Decision to use a remote server connection for Context7 MCP due to compatibility issues with local installation on Windows. This decision was made to ensure immediate usability and was validated by successful tool usage.
