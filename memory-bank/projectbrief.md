# Project Brief: Todo App

## Overview
A Next.js and TypeScript-based TODO application implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with file-based persistence, featuring both API endpoints and a web interface.

## Core Requirements
1. Create and manage TODO items
2. Persist TODO data to file system
3. Type-safe implementation using TypeScript
4. Modern web interface using Next.js
5. RESTful API endpoints for operations

## Technical Goals
- Implement robust CRUD operations
- Maintain data integrity with TypeScript types
- Provide efficient file-based storage
- Create responsive web interface
- Follow clean code principles and best practices
- Implement server-side rendering with Next.js

## Project Scope
### Phase 1 (Completed)
- Basic CRUD operations
- File-based persistence
- TypeScript implementation

### Phase 2 (Current)
- Next.js web interface
- API endpoints
- Enhanced TODO features
- Data validation and error handling

### Future Phases
- User authentication
- Categories and tags
- Due dates and reminders
- Multi-user support
- Testing infrastructure
- Performance optimizations

## Success Criteria
1. Reliable TODO item management
2. Type-safe implementation
3. Persistent data storage
4. Intuitive web interface
5. Responsive user experience
6. RESTful API functionality
