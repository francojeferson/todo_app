# Active Context for Todo App Project

## Current Focus

- Successfully set up the Context7 MCP server for enhanced coding assistance with up-to-date library documentation.
- Configured the server to use a remote connection due to local installation challenges on Windows.

## Recent Changes

- Created and updated `cline_mcp_settings.json` with the Context7 MCP server configuration.
- Demonstrated server capabilities by using the `resolve-library-id` tool to search for Next.js libraries.
- Updated markdown files in the memory bank to comply with linting rules MD022 (Headings should be surrounded by blank lines) and MD032 (Blanks around lists).

## Next Steps

- Utilize the Context7 MCP server in future tasks to fetch current documentation for libraries used in the Todo App project.
- Explore additional MCP tools like `get-library-docs` for specific documentation needs when working on relevant features.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Opted for remote server connection to bypass local installation issues, ensuring immediate usability.
- Selected `/vercel/next.js` as a relevant library ID for potential future documentation retrieval based on high trust score and snippet coverage.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Prioritize remote server configurations for MCP setups on Windows to avoid compatibility issues with local installations.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- Context7 MCP server enhances coding efficiency by providing access to current library information directly within prompts.
- Remote server setup is a viable and quick alternative when local environment constraints are encountered.
