# Raw Reflection Log for Todo App Project

---

Date: 2025-07-01
TaskRef: "Set up Context7 MCP Server"

Learnings:

- Discovered that local installation of Context7 MCP server on Windows can be challenging due to compatibility issues with Node.js execution.
- Confirmed that using a remote server connection (`https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`) is a viable alternative, providing immediate access to MCP tools.
- Successfully used the `resolve-library-id` tool, which returned relevant library IDs like `/vercel/next.js` for Next.js, demonstrating the server's capability to assist with up-to-date documentation.

Difficulties:

- Encountered issues with local installation on Windows, which led to the decision to use a remote server connection to bypass these challenges.

Successes:

- The remote server setup was effective and allowed for immediate use of MCP tools without further configuration issues.
- The `resolve-library-id` tool worked as expected, providing a list of relevant libraries with high trust scores and numerous code snippets.

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:

- General pattern: Opt for remote MCP server connections on Windows to avoid local installation issues.
- Project-specific: Document the use of Context7 MCP server for future tasks requiring library documentation in the Todo App project.
